    <h1>Cheap Print-and-Play (PnP) Netrunner</h1>
    
    <p>[Page last updated 07/13/2025]</p>

    <p>You may have heard about <a href="https://nullsignal.games/">Null Signal Games (NSG)</a>, the non-profit that rebooted Android Netrunner after <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com">Fantasy Flight Games (FFG)</a> stopped printing new sets. Null Signal Games releases all of their card art free for people to print their own copies. This document contains helpful links and a price breakdown for how much time and money it would cost for you to make your own sets!
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Cost if You <i><strong>Don't</strong></i> Make Your Own Cards</h2>
    
    <p>As of May 2025, each of the eight Null Signal sets are available for purchase for between $45 and $60+ each depending on where you buy them.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.drivethrucards.com/browse/pub/14445/Null-Signal-Games">Drive Through Cards</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/sell/nullsignalgames">Make Playing Cards</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://shop.nullsignal.games/">Null Signal Games' own store</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you factor in the cost of tokens and a card-holder box(es), this means the total cost is somewhere between $410 and $530. Yikes!</p>
    
    <h2>The Cost if You Make Your Own Cards</h2>
    
    <h3>The Punchline</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Total Cost</strong>: Printing ($60) + Paper Cutter ($30) + Tokens ($21) <br/> + Sleeving and Storage ($28 to $77 [see options below]) ~= <strong>$139 to $188</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Printing</h3>
    
    <p>The cheapest method I've found was to write some <a href="https://github.com/cheapnetrunner/photo-code">simple, hacky python scripts</a> which extract the card images from the official print-and-play PDF's and constructs images with the right dimensions for printing as photos. The current eight sets come out to a grand total of 780 photos.</p>
    
    <p>You can download the photos at these links:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxB82gnv1lHY4Q36AItnLpA46WGTbjaK/view?usp=sharing" target="source">System Gateway</a></li>

    </ul>
    
    <p>These photos are intended to be printed as 4x6 prints. Note that they are specifically designed for Snapfish, which auto-crops part of the image when they print it. After printing the cards come out to the standard 3.5x2.5" size.</p>
    
    <p>Printing Options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Snapfish -- This is the option I recommend, particularly when they have their unlimited "1-cent" (so-called) photo deals, which seem to run about once every month. They charge a lot on shipping, but you still get a good price per photo. <strong>I was able to order the whole collection of photos for under $60</strong> -- under 7.7 cents per photo.</li>
        <li>Walmart Photo -- Walmart has a consistent price of 14 cents per photo, yielding a total order price of $110.</li>
        <li>[any photo deal you can find]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Card-Cutting</h3>
    
    <p>You will want a guillotine paper-cutter like one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Swingline-ClassicCut-Lite-Guillotine-Trimmer-12-Cut-Length-10-Sheet-Capacity/14916713">Swingline Guillotine Trimmer</a> ($40)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Paper-Cutter-12-Cut-Length-Paper-Trimmer-Guillotine-Trimmer-12-sheet-Capacity-Paper-Cutting-Board-Heavy-Duty-Guillotine-Paper-Cutters-Trimmers-Cardst/5452640179">Jisesili Guillotine Trimmer</a> ($30)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tokens</h3>
    
    <p>You can get nice, cheap Netrunner <a href="https://burgertokens.com/products/netrunner-tokens">tokens from Burger Tokens</a> -- $20 plus 50 cents in pennies.</p>
    
    <h3>Sleeving and Storage</h3>
    
    <p>Photos are way too flimsy and see-through to use as cards without some kind of backing or card sleeve. Sleeving provides a nice looking card-back and some much-needed structural support.</p>
    
    <p>For reference, there are roughly 840 corp cards in the current collection and roughly 720 runner cards.</p>

    <h4>Option A ($28 - $31)</h4>
    
    <p>Sleeve <strong>only</strong> your drafted decks in top-quality card sleeves: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=dragon+shield+standard+size+matte+sleeves">100 matte "Dragon Shield" sleeves</a> for $12-$15.</p>
    
    <p>Store your sleeved and your unsleeved cards in a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=BCW+Super+Shoe+Storage+Box*+(3000+CT)">box like this ($16)</a>. You may wish to make some dividers of your own out of an old cardboard box.</p>
    
    <h4>Option B ($70+)</h4>
    
    <p>Sleeve <strong>all</strong> the cards in some of the cheapest sleeves to be found: "Kitoyz" <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleeves-Trading-Protectors-Compatible-Baseball/dp/B0CBT816N8?th=1">Red</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleeves-Trading-Protectors-Compatible-Baseball/dp/B0CBT792L8?th=1">Blue</a> 500-packs of matte card sleeves for $14 each. <strong>Get two packs of each color (blue for corp, red for runner) or three packs of the same color plus a 100-pack for monetary efficiency.</strong> My apologies that they are from Amazon.</p>
    
    <p>Store them in a box like in option A.</p>
    
    <p>For the flippable identities, you can either acquire some clear card sleeves or you can just tape two card sleeves back-to-back.</p>
    
    <p>If you feel that these card sleeves are too flimsy or the backs are too see-through for play, you can buy a regular deck of cards and insert those into the sleeves of your drafted deck since a typical drafted deck is under 50 cards. Alternatively you could just have nice sleeves for your drafted decks, like in Option A.</p>

    <h4>Option C ($49 - $77)</h4>
    
    <p>Sleeve your drafted cards like in Option A and store them in a box <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=ultrapro+100%252B+deck+box">like this ($11)</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Then store your unsleeved cards in <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=2+inch+d-ring+binder">two 2" D-ring binders</a> (ranging from $8 to $17 each) with <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=card+sleeves+for+binders">card sleeves for binders</a> like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pockets-Trading-Sleeves-Baseball-Standard/dp/B0BV1LYTDN">these ($10 for 900 sleeves, $17 for 1800 sleeves)</a>. Note that I have not tested these sleeve pages, so I cannot vouch for their durability. I also do not know if you'd need to sleeve the photos individually or if you can safely stuff the 3 identical photos per distinct netrunner card into a single sleeve.<p>

    <h3>Time You're Busy Cutting and Sleeving</h3>
    
    <p>When I get into a focused groove, I can knock out a set in about 1 hour. This would bring the total amount of work to 8 hours, but that's quite optimistic. Realistically you're probably looking at 12+ hours of work at least, especially if you get distracted reading the cards.</p>
