    <h1>Cheap Print-and-Play (PnP) Netrunner</h1>
    
    <p>[Page last updated 05/07/2025]</p>

    <p>You may have heard about <a href="https://nullsignal.games/">Null Signal Games (NSG)</a>, the non-profit that rebooted Android Netrunner after <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com">Fantasy Flight Games (FFG)</a> stopped printing new sets. Null Signal Games releases all of their card art free for people to print their own copies. This document contains helpful links and a price breakdown for how much time and money it would cost for you to make your own sets!
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Cost if You <i><strong>Don't</strong></i> Make Your Own Cards</h2>
    
    <p>As of May 2025, each of the eight Null Signal sets are available for purchase for between $45 and $60+ each depending on where you buy them.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.drivethrucards.com/browse/pub/14445/Null-Signal-Games">Drive Through Cards</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/sell/nullsignalgames">Make Playing Cards</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://shop.nullsignal.games/">Null Signal Games' own store</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you factor in the cost of tokens and a card-holder box(es), this means the total cost is somewhere between $410 and $530. Yikes!</p>
    
    <h2>The Cost if You Make Your Own Cards</h2>
    
    <h3>The Punchline</h3>
    
    <p>Total Cost (rounded up): Printing ($60) + Paper Cutter ($40) + Card Sleeves ($37) + Tokens ($21) + Storage ($20) ~= <strong>$180</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Printing</h3>
    
    <p>The cheapest method I've found was to write a simple, hacky python script which extracts the card images from the official print-and-play PDF's and puts them on images in the right dimension for printing as photos. The current eight sets come out to a grand total of 780 photos.</p>
    
    <p>Printing Options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Snapfish -- This is the option I recommend, particularly when they have their "1-cent" (so-called) photo deals, which seem to run about once every month. They charge a lot on shipping, but you still get a good price per photo. <strong>I was able to order the whole collection of photos for under $60</strong> -- under 7.7 cents per photo.</li>
        <li>Walmart Photo -- Walmart has a consistent price of 14 cents per photo, yielding a total order price of $110.</li>
        <li>[any photo deal you can find]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Actual Photos:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kxB82gnv1lHY4Q36AItnLpA46WGTbjaK/view?usp=sharing" target="source">System Gateway</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7K5Z92qocV9yxC2TPyo4SzaH1Cewd1A/view?usp=sharing" target="source">Elevation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jj9dFRibsMPEv8_ucZC6wx0j4FtXngR3/view?usp=sharing" target="source">Ashes Cycle</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4G2XeY4hKyrRY1tGf8zrfPcFabc5UpI/view?usp=sharing" target="source">Borealis Cycle</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bsfN6ny3_5pCrxgDbt8e4C7abC_mZFNo/view?usp=sharing" target="source">Liberation Cycle</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These photos are intended to be printed as 4x6 prints. Note that they are specifically designed for Snapfish, which auto-crops part of the image when they print it. After printing the cards come out to the standard 3.5x2.5" size.</p>
    
    <h3>Card-Cutting</h3>
    
    <p>You will want a guillotine paper-cutter like one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=swingline+classiccut+12%22+lite+guillotine+trimmer">Swingline Guillotine Trimmer</a> ($40)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Guillotine-Heavy-Duty-10-Sheet/dp/B07LFHSRNB">"Amazon Basics" Guillotine Trimmer</a> ($30)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Sleeving</h3>
    
    <p>Photos are way too flimsy and see-through to use as cards without some kind of backing or card sleeve. Sleeving provides a nice looking card-back and some much-needed structural support.</p>
    
    <p>The cheapest sleeves I found: "Kitoyz" <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleeves-Trading-Protectors-Compatible-Baseball/dp/B0CBT816N8?th=1">Red</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sleeves-Trading-Protectors-Compatible-Baseball/dp/B0CBT792L8?th=1">Blue</a> 500-packs of matte card sleeves for $14 each. The red pack will handle all your runner cards and the blue pack all of your corp cards.</p>
    
    <p>You'll also want a few <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=100+clear+card+sleeves">clear card sleeves</a> for the flippable identities.</p>
    
    <h3>Time You're Busy Cutting and Sleeving</h3>
    
    <p>When I get into a focused groove, I can knock out a set in about 1 hour. This would bring the total amount of work to 8 hours, but that's quite optimistic. Realistically you're probably looking at 12+ hours of work, especially if you get distracted reading the cards.</p>
    
    <h3>Tokens</h3>
    
    <p>You can get nice, cheap Netrunner <a href="https://burgertokens.com/products/netrunner-tokens">tokens from Burger Tokens</a> -- $20 plus $1 in pennies.</p>
    
    <h3>Storage</h3>
    
    <p>I made my own storage with a cardboard box and some sheet metal, but <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=BCW+Super+Shoe+Storage+Box*+(3000+CT)">you can buy boxes</a> for this sort of thing.</p>
